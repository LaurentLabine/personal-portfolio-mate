{"data":{"contentfulAbout":{"aboutMe":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"rawMarkdownBody":"Hey there ðŸ‘‹\n\nI am Laurent.  A (mostly) self-taught programmer from Canada.  I graduated with a bachelor's in electrical engineering before finding my place in the world of flight simulation as an integration specialist for the bigger part of a decade before the world changed in early 2020.  This is where I re-evaluated and opted for learning web development following freeCodeCamp's portfolio.\n\nOver the last few months I have worked my way towards completing the many projects exploring various topics to gathering the following certifications:\n\n* [Responsive Web Design](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/)    Basic HTML & CSS skills as well as responsive web design principles.\n* [JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/)    Javascript Fundamentals\n* [Front End Development Libraries](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/)    Some of the most popular front end libraries out there (React, Redux, SASS, jQuery)\n* [Data Visualization](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-visualization/)    Dip into the world of Data visualization and SVG standards using D3.js\n* [APIs and Microservices](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/apis-and-microservices/)    Learning the ropes of Express.js based microservices and APIs operation.\n* [Quality Assurance](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/quality-assurance/)    Javascript Testing using Mocha and Chai\n* [Scientific Computing with Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/)    Learning pythons fundamentals\n* [Data Analysis with Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/)    Fundamentals of data analysis using Python\n* [Information Security](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/information-security/) Building and securing apps using HelmetJS to learn the fundamentals of protecting people's information online\n* [Machine Learning with Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/machine-learning-with-python/)    A quick dive into neural networks, and the principles behind how deep, recurrent, and convolutional neural networks work using Tensorflow"}},"profile":{"title":"Mate Logo","image":{"src":"//images.ctfassets.net/f82w24pkfj3b/6nf3rNaaVaUqYcoAcciSeC/4f27bf36cdfcabf272990059e6e5da7c/Mate_Logo.png?w=450&q=100"}}}}}
