This is my first Gatsby site.

It is accessible [here](https://laurentlabine.github.io/personal-portfolio-mate/)

I bootstrapped it using the Gatsby Starter Mate accessible [here](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/starters/EmaSuriano/gatsby-starter-mate/)

The purpose was a few folds:

* Quickly set myself up with my first personal portfolio website
* Get an introduction to gatsby website generation as well as headless CMS
* Learn Shadow Theming as well as deployment techniques.

The content is managed via [Contenful headless CMS](https://www.contentful.com/) for streamlining the integration and making content editing it's on thing.
